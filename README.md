# SPACEASCIIGAME

A personal project created by Patrick Mooney to learn Java, game design, and UX

Controls:

Start Screen: enter to generate random world


Main Screen: Q opens planet manager
              T opens technology manager
              V opens up planet manager for selected system
              
              
Planet Manager:
F -> Type in a filter for planets
Space -> switch between colonized and colonization candidates
W/S -> scroll left
UP/DOWN -> scroll right
LEFT/RIGHT -> slide production distribution bars
P -> toggle display power
N -> toggle display star names
L -> toggle dispaly hyperlanes (bugged)

Fleet Manager:
M -> toggle automerge (all fleets with automerge join together when in same system) default = true
ENTER -> Set fleet destination
UP/DOWN scroll

BUGS:
hyperlanes do not dissapear from dispaly until tiles are updated...


Production: how the resources generated by a planet are allocated on that planet
Population: grows logistically based on maximum carrying capacity of planet. K is based on habitability and size.
V -> sort arrays (habitability, alphabetically, production)
to add: population, distance, cost, bonuses.
added: COLONIZATION SHIPS
NEXT: ACTUAL SHIPS and combat
science ships
planetary defenses


TO ADD:
   fleet management -> desired ratios, upgrading, repairing, combat
   attacking/planet defense -> building defense structures, invading planets
   random events -> anomolies, warp anomolies, political events, etc
   exploration -> fog of war
   more technologies -> fleet tech, economy tech, terraforming tech
   diplomacy -> relationships, AI, political climate, AI preferences
   racial stats -> bonuses, select screen
   saving/loading
   politics -> government, elections
   NPCs -> neutral monsters, solar system bosses, end game crisis
   technology -> progression and unlocking and selection
  
Technologies:
 
 
 Terraforming: 
      Soil (basic) 10 -> 20
      Temperature, Radiation, Atmosphere, Moisture
      Increase temp -> Reduce ice caps -> add water
      Ozone -> lower radiation, increase breathability
      Radiogenic bacteria -> lower radiation, increase soil
      Greehouse cycling -> increase temp, reduce radiation
      Ice asteroid dropping -> increase water levels
      Lagrange supermagnet -> reduce radiation
